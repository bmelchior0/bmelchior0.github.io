  <h1>Where's home from here?</h1>
   <h2>Berenike Melchior, 2024</h2>
<p>360° screen, 6-channel looping video, <br>responsive 3D animation, responsive sound, <br>monitor, keyboard
</p>
  <p>“Where’s home from here” is a 360° video installation that transforms live weather data from a
given location into an immersive experience. The work engages with a multiplicitous sense of
location in a world that takes place as much online as off. When we are displaced from our
homes, the online connections to those places can offer solace. Simultaneously, they take us out
of the physical spaces we are in. “Where’s home from here” allows the audience to influence the
parameters of the installation. As they type the name of a new location, the environment shifts
subtly—sound and light change, abstracting real weather. Almost void of humans the installation may become a projection space,
    allowing the viewer to inhabit a sense of solitary unique to contemplating home in a foreign place.
