  <p>"A hidden eye that sees? Not much." is a videographic documentation of a dance performance captured on a webcam on October 15, 2023. A dancer enters public space, moves, creating micro disruptions in the uniform motion of Sunday afternoon strolls. A camera is fastened somewhere above, continuously streaming images into the public space of the world wide web. Online, below the (since taken offline) live video stream, the statement ‚Äú7 online‚Äù publishes the number of viewers that may (or may not) be watching. The audience is constantly in flux and never visible. <br>
Beginning with a dance performance in public space under the watchful eye of a 24/7 live webcam and concluding with a poster exhibited on the street, "A hidden eye that sees? Not much." attempts to shed light on the surveillance of public space by using the live stream as a stage on which to perform to an audience of ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. A QR code is placed in frame of the webcam, inviting passersby to an interaction with the digital realm, at once exhibiting the work and exposing regimes of surveillance. But does it remain surveillance if no one is watching? If nothing distinct is seen, why record at all?</p>
