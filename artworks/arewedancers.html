  <h1>Are We Dancers</h1>
   <h2>Berenike Melchior, 2023</h2>
<p>Video, 5:10 mins <br>
Sound: Half-speed edit of Human by The Killers
</p>
  <p>"Are We Dancers" is a duet between human and computer. Pose estimation is the language with which they communicate. It allows the computer to inhabit the human world, by understanding human movement. The dancer moves, and her movement is translated into a visual response. The velocity of each keypoint mapped to her body is transposed onto a <a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/colors/colormaps.html" target="_blank">colormap</a> and arranged in a matrix of squares beside her. Raw motion data, captured using the <a href="https://github.com/HRNet/DEKR" target="_blank">disentangled keypoint regression model (DEKR)</a>, reveals something previously unseen and enables a duet in the digital realm.<br>
"Are We Dancers" takes its name from the 2008 The Killer’s song “Human”. “Human” is an ode to humanness and a tender goodbye as lead singer Brandon Flowers crosses into another realm (death? the digital? We never find out.). Wild cats run through the desert, and Flowers sings: “I’m on my knees begging for the answer. Are we human, or are we dancer?”.  The sincerity with which he asks this as he stares into the camera feels oddly prescient in the newly begun era of generative AI. <br>
In "Are We Dancers" humanness itself is not up for question. Instead, the work approaches the current anxiety pervading all fields of creative production in the face of emerging technologies.</p>
